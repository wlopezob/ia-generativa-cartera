# Agent Development Kit (ADK) + Vertex AI RAG Engine

url: **https://github.com/arjunprabhulal/adk-vertex-ai-rag-engine**

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine built with Google's [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and [Vertex AI RAG Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/rag-engine/rag-overview). This project provides a modular framework for managing Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets, RAG corpora, and document retrieval with a focus on best practices and user experience.

## Vertex AI RAG Engine

Vertex AI RAG Engine is a component of the Vertex AI Platform that facilitates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and serves as a data framework for developing context-augmented large language model (LLM) applications. It enables you to enrich LLM context with your organization's private knowledge, reducing hallucinations and improving answer accuracy.

### RAG Process Concepts

These concepts are listed in the order of the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process:

1. **Data ingestion**: Intake data from different data sources. For example, local files, Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.

2. **Data transformation**: Conversion of the data in preparation for indexing. For example, data is split into chunks.

3. **Embedding**: Numerical representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the high-dimensional vector space.

4. **Data indexing**: Vertex AI RAG Engine creates an index called a corpus. The index structures the knowledge base so it's optimized for searching. For example, the index is like a detailed table of contents for a massive reference book.

5. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the retrieval component in Vertex AI RAG Engine searches through its knowledge base to find information that is relevant to the query.

6. **Generation**: The retrieved information becomes the context added to the original user query as a guide for the generative AI model to generate factually grounded and relevant responses.

## Agent Development Kit (ADK)

[Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. Key features include:

- **Model-Agnostic**: While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK works with any model.
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Define workflows using workflow agents (`Sequential`, `Parallel`, `Loop`) or leverage LLM-driven dynamic routing for adaptive behavior.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Build modular applications by composing multiple specialized agents in a hierarchy.
- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Equip agents with diverse capabilities through pre-built tools, custom functions, third-party integrations, or even other agents as tools.
- **Deployment Ready**: Deploy agents anywhere ‚Äì locally, on Vertex AI Agent Engine, or using Cloud Run/Docker.
- **Built-in Evaluation**: Assess agent performance by evaluating both response quality and execution trajectory.

ADK makes agent development feel more like software development, making it easier to create, deploy, and orchestrate agents ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows.

Each corpus contains relevant PDF documents imported from Google and Kaggle's Gen AI Intensive course:

- [Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering](https://lnkd.in/d-_w3gXj)
- [Day 2: Embeddings & Vector Stores / Databases](https://lnkd.in/dkmfDUcp)
- [Day 3: Generative AI Agents](https://lnkd.in/dd3Zd2-F)
- [Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs](https://lnkd.in/d6Z39yqt)
- [Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI](https://lnkd.in/dcXCTPVF)

These documents are from Google and Kaggle's Gen AI Intensive course, which broke the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS‚Ñ¢ title for the Largest Attendance at a Virtual AI Conference in One Week with more than 280,000 signups in just 20 days. The materials provide a comprehensive overview of Vertex AI capabilities and best practices for working with generative AI.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture based on the ADK framework:

![ADK Vertex AI RAG Architecture](.Images/ADK-VertexAI-RAG-Architecture.png)

The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **User Interface**: Interact with the system through ADK Web or CLI
2. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: The core orchestration layer that manages tools and user interactions
3. **Function Tools**: Modular components divided into:
   - **Storage Tools**: For GCS bucket and file management
   - **RAG Corpus Tools**: For corpus management and semantic search
4. **Google Cloud Services**:
   - **Google Cloud Storage**: Stores document files
   - **Vertex AI RAG Engine**: Provides embedding, indexing and retrieval capabilities
   - **Gemini 2.0 LLM Model**: Generates responses grounded in retrieved contexts

## Usage

### Running the Agent

There are two ways to run the agent:

```bash
# Option 1: Use ADK web interface (recommended for interactive usage)
adk web 

# Option 2: Run the agent directly in the terminal
adk run rag
```

The web interface provides a chat-like experience for interacting with the agent, while the direct run option is suitable for scripting and automated workflows.

# Create a bucket for Foundation LLMs
[user]: Create a GCS bucket named "adk-embedding-vector-stores"

# Upload a document
[user]: Upload this PDF file to GCS bucket gs://adk-embedding-vector-stores/ and keep the same destination blob name

# Create a RAG corpus
[user]: Create a RAG corpus named "adk-embedding-vector-stores" with description "adk-embedding-vector-stores"
